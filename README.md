## How it Works
### Checklist
- Make sure you have MetaMask installed and logged in on your browser.
- Make sure that your MetaMask wallet is correctly configured to connect to BSC Testnet. Refer to this [guide](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain) for details.
- Create a file named ```.secret```, save your MetaMask Secret Phrase in this file.
- Run the command ```truffle compile``` to compile the smart contracts.
- Run the command ```truffle migrate --reset --network bscTestnet``` to deploy the contract on the BSC Testnet.
- Run the command ```npm run build``` to build the application.
- Run the command ```npm run dev``` to start the application.

### How to Use
1. Open browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:3000/```
2. Make sure that your MetaMask wallet is correctly installed and configured to connect to BSC Testnet. Refer to this [guide](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain) for details.
3. Select your desired account of MetaMask that has BNB Test tokens to perform transactions.
4. To get test tokens use the [BNB Smart Chain Faucet](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart).
5. Click on Greet Button to display message, by default its Hello World.
6. Enter a name in the input field, Click save button to save the name.
7. Confirm the transaction when MetaMask notification pops up.
8. Click on Greet Button to display message along with the last name saved with the current account.

## Unit Test of Smart Contracts
- Make sure that Ganache is running. This is important because testing is done on the local network.
- From the root directory of the project, open command prompt.
- Run the command ```truffle test``` to run the tests.
  
## Unit Test Coverage
```sh
  Contract: HelloWorld
    √ Default message should be hello, world (264ms)
    √ Should save name (796ms)
    √ Should be default message for other accounts (412ms)
    √ Should throw error on empty name (3306ms)


  4 passing (5s)
